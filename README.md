# Brain Games

«Brain Games» — a set of five console games built on the principle of popular mobile applications for brain pumping. Each game asks questions that need to be answered correctly. After three correct answers, it is considered that the game is over. Incorrect answers end the game and offer to go through it again.

### Install the package and run

### Games:

```brain-calc``` - Calculator
```brain-progression``` - Progression
```brain-even``` - Definition of an even number
```brain-gcd``` - Finding the Greatest Common Divisor
```brain-prime``` - Definition of a prime number

### Demonstration:

1. Calculator. The player is shown a random mathematical expression, such as 35 + 16, which must be calculated and the correct answer written down.
