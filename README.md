# Brain Games

"Brain Games" — a set of five console games built on the principle of popular mobile applications for brain pumping. Each game asks questions that need to be answered correctly. After three correct answers, it is considered that the game is over. Incorrect answers end the game and offer to go through it again.

## Installation:

### Use the package manager pip:

    pip install --user git+https://github.com/Dmitry-Zhiryakov/python-project-lvl1.git

## Or
### Clone repository and use poetry:

Clone repository `git clone https://github.com/Dmitry-Zhiryakov/python-project-lvl1.git`

Install dependencies `make install`

Build the package `make build`

Install package `make package-install`

## Games:

1. **Calculator.** The player is shown a random mathematical expression, such as 35 + 16, which must be calculated and the correct answer written down.  

    Run the command `brain-calc` to start the game "Сalculator".

2. **Progression.** The player is shown a series of numbers forming an arithmetic progression. It is necessary to determine the missing number, replaced by two dots.  

    Run the command `brain-progression` to start the game "Progression".

3. **Definition of an even number.** The player is shown a random number and needs to answer 'yes' if the number is even, or 'no' if it's odd.  
 
    Run the command `brain-even` to start the game "Definition of an even number".

4. **Finding the Greatest Common Divisor.** The player is shown two random numbers, eg '25 50'. The player must calculate and enter the greatest common divisor of these numbers.  
 
    Run the command `brain-gcd` to start the game "Finding the Greatest Common Divisor".

5. **Definition of a prime number.** The player is shown a random number and needs to answer 'yes' if the number is prime. Otherwise, 'no' should be answered.  

    Run the command `brain-prime` to start the game "Definition of a prime number".
